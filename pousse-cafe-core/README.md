# Introduction

Pousse-Café is a framework assisting you in writing applications following Domain Driven Design methodology. While DDD
has proven to be useful in writing code representing complex business rules and/or having strong scalability requirements,
it is not always easy to apply given the number of transversal issues that need to be addressed. Pousse-Café's purpose
is to solve most of those issues allowing developers to focus on the Domain and its implementation.

This project is the Core module of Pousse-Café. It features an almost completely technology independent implementation
of Domain Driven Design components (Aggregates, Factories, Repositories, etc.).

To see a concrete example of how Core can be used to write business logic implementation, please have a look at the
Sample Domain.
