# Introduction

Pousse-Café is a framework assisting you in writing applications following Domain Driven Design methodology. While DDD
has proven to be useful in writing code representing complex business rules and/or having strong scalability requirements,
it is not always easy to apply given the number of transversal issues that need to be addressed. Pousse-Café's purpose
is to solve most of those issues allowing developers to focus on the Domain and its implementation.

This project is the Sample Domain module of Pousse-Café. It shows how, by depending on Core and Test modules, you can already
write code focusing on business logic and be able to test it using Domain Driven Design ways (i.e. testing the Aggregates
but also the work flows related to handling Domain Events).

To see a concrete example of how the Sample Domain can be integrated in an actual back-end, see Sample App module.
