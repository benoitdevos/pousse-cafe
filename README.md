# Introduction

Pousse-Café is a framework assisting you in writing applications following Domain Driven Design methodology. While DDD
has proven to be useful in writing code representing complex business rules and/or having strong scalability requirements,
it is not always easy to apply given the number of transversal issues that need to be addressed. Pousse-Café is meant
to solved most of those issues allowing developers to focus on the Domain and its implementation.

This project is the parent project of all Pousse-Café modules. Pousse-Café is essentially composed of:

- The Core module: Pousse-Café's key components
- The Test module: Components helping in writing powerful and Domain-centric unit tests
