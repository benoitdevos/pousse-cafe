# Introduction

Pousse-Café is a framework assisting you in writing applications following Domain Driven Design methodology. While DDD
has proven to be useful in writing code representing complex business rules and/or having strong scalability requirements,
it is not always easy to apply given the number of transversal issues that need to be addressed. Pousse-Café's purpose
is to solve most of those issues allowing developers to focus on the Domain and its implementation.

This project is the Test module of Pousse-Café. It enables the testing of Domain logic without caring about underlying
storage and messaging technologies.

To see a concrete example of how Test module is used, see Sample Domain.
