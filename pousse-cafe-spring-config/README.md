# Introduction

Pousse-Café is a framework assisting you in writing applications following Domain Driven Design methodology. While DDD
has proven to be useful in writing code representing complex business rules and/or having strong scalability requirements,
it is not always easy to apply given the number of transversal issues that need to be addressed. Pousse-Café's purpose
is to solve most of those issues allowing developers to focus on the Domain and its implementation.

This project is the Spring Config module of Pousse-Café. It bridges Pousse-Café's configuration tooling with Spring's
application context configuration. In particular, it provides a Spring implementation of Pousse-Café's application
configuration.

To see a concrete example of how Spring Config module is used, see Sample App.
